Quantifying Kawhi Leonard's value on the court 

The Kawhi Leonard saga seems to have reduced to a simmer. The 27-year old is with the Toronto Raptors and DeMar Derozan is now a Spur. The Raptors are banking that Leonard regains his superstar status of his age 25 season after a quad-injury shortened season. 

The Spurs might be a better spot with DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, and a first-round draft pick then holding onto Leonard. Even if Leonard doesn’t jump to Los Angeles or another team following  next season, it is quite possible that the Spurs front office was not keen on offering him a max contract with his lingering injury. 

Still, Leonard still has potential to be franchise altering player fitting in the Kyrie Irving or Klay Thompson mold in terms of his value (not playing style). For those fans with short memories, Leonard’s 6.2 VORP in 2016-17 ranked 7th out of 538 players in their age 25 season dating over 2003-04 through 2017-18! 

Analytics also supports Leonard’s value on the court. For instance, a k-nearest neighbor algorithm reveals that Leonard’s age 25 season mirrors that of Victor Oladipo (4.2 Euclidean distance), Paul George (5.2), Danny Granger (5.2), Kyrie Irving (5.5), and Kobe Bryant (6.1). The above players continue(d) to produce high VORP over their next few seasons. Even Danny Granger didn’t drop-off until his age 29 season.
